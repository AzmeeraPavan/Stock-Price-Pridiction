# Stock-Price-Pridiction
 predicting stock prices is a challenging task, and the accuracy of your model will depend on various factors, including the features you use and the complexity of your chosen algorithm
Define the Scope:
Clearly define the scope of your project. Are you predicting the stock prices of a specific company, a particular sector, or the overall market? Decide the time frame for your predictions (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly).

Data Collection:
Gather historical stock price data for the chosen stock or market index. You can obtain this data from financial websites, APIs, or databases. Additionally, collect relevant financial indicators, news sentiment, or macroeconomic factors that may influence stock prices.

Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the data. Handle missing values, outliers, and format the data in a way that is suitable for machine learning algorithms. Create features that might be relevant for predicting stock prices, such as moving averages, technical indicators, or sentiment scores.

Feature Engineering:
Extract meaningful features from the data that can help your machine learning model make accurate predictions. This might involve calculating daily returns, creating lag features, or incorporating external factors like economic indicators.

Split the Data:
Split your dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train your model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

Choose a Model:
Select a machine learning model suitable for time series forecasting. Common models include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and more advanced models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs).

Training the Model:
Train your chosen model using the training dataset. Adjust hyperparameters as needed to optimize performance.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or others relevant to your specific goals.

Fine-Tuning and Optimization:
Fine-tune your model based on the evaluation results. This may involve adjusting parameters, trying different algorithms, or incorporating additional features.

Prediction and Visualization:
Use your trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data. Visualize the predicted vs. actual stock prices to understand how well your model is performing.

Deployment (Optional):
If applicable, deploy your model to a platform where it can make real-time predictions. This step might not be necessary for a summer project, but it's worth considering for a more extended or real-world application.

Documentation:
Document your project thoroughly. Explain your methodology, choices, and results in a clear and concise manner.
